This is my Assignment for the Tracking Project.
A skeleton model is placed over the top of the hand and keypoints are located on key features such as joints to create a replica model of the hand using lines and circles.
I decided to utilize this concept to create a replica of space invaders where the gun is controlled by tracking hand movements.
The direction the gun points is based upon the angle of the pointer finger and it adjust in real-time to give semi-accurate shots on target.
