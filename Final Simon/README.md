Welcome to the folder for my final project in HAR-371 Creative Programming II!

I have always been a fan of trying to recreate old/classic games whenever possible in for the assignments in class. This, in general comes from my love of classic games, as well as my past experience working in retail for the recently bankrupt Toys-R-Us. This time around I reached way back to when I first started working, and chose one of the very first games I had to showcase in-store:

SIMON!!!

Simon, being simple, fun, and a beloved childhood game, seemed to be a nice way to finish off this year's class. With this I have spent the last few works getting the game to work while also trying to make it appealing to play, as well as similar in nature to the original game.



Originally I wasn't sure of how much work would be entailed in recreating the game, thinking "How hard could it be? it's just a randomized array of colors thats added to each round.", but I quickly came to realize that it was much more than just that. Although it was relatively easy to create a randomized array that's added to each round, it was much more difficult to set up all of the timing between sounds, clicks, displaying the new rounds sequence and making sure the sounds are spaced out, and a myriad of other timing issues. I also ran into the issue that apparently buttons are always displayed over anything that isn't a button, so any pop-ups like the start/play again had to be implemented as a button. Any text had to be put in the top bar so that the user could see it. Then just to throw oil onto the fire, I had to account for resizability, namely in the size of the buttons, as well as the size of the text within the buttons. 

These were just the majorly glaring problems that I had to fix/figure out, but in the end I believe I have a product that works very well and stays true to the original design of the game Simon. There is still much more than could be added, but that will have to wait for the future as the restraint of time and other finals has taken up much of my free time. There is an example mp4 that you can download and watch for an example, or geel free to run the code yourself, or visit the link to the p5js page to give it a go.
