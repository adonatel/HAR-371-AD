This Folder is dedicated to the Mask Assignment where we will use face/skeleton tracking to create superimposed masks over our faces

Much of my life has been filled with family that comes from Italy, and I felt it would be fun to incorporate some italian-themed imagery into the mask that I've created. My family has always been fond of creating and cooking our own meals/food, whether it be pasta, sausage, meatballs, and even wine. I've tried to combine these into the symbol that is the traditional chefs hat, to signify the love of cooking that me and my family has. I also included a wine bottle that appears when you open your mouth, and I couldn't forget to add that iconic italian stache that many people love. I've also included a classic gold chain as well as a small 'mom' tattoo to put a cherry on top.
